# testeranto.ts

ðŸš§ under heavy development! ðŸš§ I'm hoping to have a 1.0.0 release by the end of the year ðŸ¤ž but until then _caveat emptor_.

## about

Testeranto.ts an Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) testing framework. Testeranto focuses on specifing stateful logic which crosses applications boundaries with strong type bindings and using an extended gherkin syntax.

### an example

---

```ts
class Rectangle {
  height: number;
  width: number;

  constructor(height: number = 2, width: number = 2) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }

  getHeight() {
    return this.height;
  }

  getWidth() {
    return this.width;
  }

  setHeight(height: number) {
    this.height = height;
  }

  setWidth(width: number) {
    this.width = width;
  }

  area(): number {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }

  circumference(): number {
    return this.width * 2 + this.height * 2;
  }
}
```

```ts
export default Rectangle;

const RectangleTesteranto = TesterantoClassicFactory<
  Rectangle,
  {
    Default: "hello";
  },
  {
    Default: [never];
    WidthOfOneAndHeightOfOne: [never];
    WidthAndHeightOf: [number, number];
  },
  {
    HeightIsPubliclySetTo: [number];
    WidthIsPubliclySetTo: [number];
    setWidth: [number];
    setHeight: [number];
  },
  {
    AreaPlusCircumference: [number];
    circumference: [number];
    getWidth: [number];
    getHeight: [number];
    area: [number];
    prototype: [string];
  }
>(Rectangle, (Suite, Given, When, Then) => {
  const RectangleSuite = Suite.Default;
  return [
    RectangleSuite([
      Given.Default(
        [When.setWidth(4), When.setHeight(9)],

        [Then.getWidth(4), Then.getHeight(9)]
      ),

      Given.WidthOfOneAndHeightOfOne(
        [When.setWidth(4), When.setHeight(5)],
        [
          Then.getWidth(4),
          Then.getHeight(5),
          Then.area(20),
          Then.AreaPlusCircumference(38),
        ]
      ),
      Given.WidthOfOneAndHeightOfOne(
        [When.setHeight(4), When.setWidth(3)],
        [Then.area(12)]
      ),
      Given.WidthOfOneAndHeightOfOne(
        [
          When.setHeight(3),
          When.setWidth(4),
          When.setHeight(5),
          When.setWidth(6),
        ],
        [Then.area(30), Then.circumference(22)]
      ),
      Given.WidthOfOneAndHeightOfOne(
        [When.setHeight(3), When.setWidth(4)],
        [
          Then.getHeight(3),
          Then.getWidth(4),
          Then.area(12),
          Then.circumference(14),
        ]
      ),
    ]),
  ];
});
```

### the good parts

Testeranto can very feasibly be used to test any code- a ruby HTTP server, for example. While testeranto itself and it's test implementations are typescript, the subject of the test can be any stateful software.

Testeranto allows you to test the same code in multiple ways. You can test your TS in a granular, unit-test fashion, and also bundle it and test it through an interface like puppeteer, bridging TDD and BDD patterns.

Testeranto exposes an extended gherkin syntax. You can use the given-when-then lingua-franca, AND you can also use an imperative style which is a bit more flexible.

Testeranto.ts is very lightweight and unopinionated. It is comprised entirely of ~1000 lines of typescript, with only 1 dependency (lodash).

### the bad parts

Testerano is not for testing pure functions. It's designed only to address _stateful_ logic.

Because testerano is so unopinionated, it does not provide test infrastructure. You will need to find an existing recipe or implement it yourself. Depending on your needs, you will need to implement an interface which extends 1 of 2 classes:
1] `TesterantoClassic`, when you only need to test a class
2] `TesterantoBasic`, when you need to test something more complex
